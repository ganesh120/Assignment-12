What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\nIn Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs, the program stops executing and Python raises an error message that describes the type of exception that occurred and the line of code where the exception occurred.\n\nExceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as when a program tries to perform an operation on data that is not the expected type or when a program tries to access a resource that is not available. Python provides a set of built-in Exception classes that can be used to handle different types of exceptions.\n\nSyntax errors, on the other hand, occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the Python code itself. These errors occur before the program is executed and are caught by the Python interpreter before the code is run. Examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close a parentheses or a quotation mark, or using an incorrect keyword or operator.\n\nHere's an example that demonstrates the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Example of an Exception\ntry:\n    a = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n\n# Example of a Syntax error\nb = 10\nif b = 5:\n    print(\"b is equal to 5\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-09T13:04:59.430009Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-09T13:04:59.430791Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-09T13:04:59.465429Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-09T13:04:59.430714Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-09T13:04:59.463822Z"}},"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  Cell \u001b[0;32mIn[1], line 9\u001b[0;36m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    if b = 5:\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m       ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax.

What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example\nIn Python, custom exceptions can be defined by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. These custom exceptions can be used to represent specific error conditions that are not covered by the built-in exceptions, and can provide more specific information about what went wrong in the code.\n\nWe need custom exceptions in Python when we want to raise exceptions that are specific to our own code or application. By creating custom exceptions, we can give more meaningful error messages and provide better feedback to the user. This can help with debugging and troubleshooting, and can make our code more readable and maintainable.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a custom exception in Python:","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class NegativeNumberError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, number):\n        self.number = number\n        self.message = \"Error: Negative number not allowed\"\n        super().__init__(self.message)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.message}: {self.number}\"\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b < 0:\n        raise NegativeNumberError(b)\n    else:\n        return a / b\n\ntry:\n    result = divide(10, -5)\nexcept NegativeNumberError as e:\n    print(e)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-09T13:07:45.056266Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-09T13:07:45.057591Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-09T13:07:45.065319Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-09T13:07:45.057536Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-09T13:07:45.064093Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Error: Negative number not allowed: -5\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Q6.
